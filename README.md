# A Video Game API
A WEB API for my [GameCRUDApp](https://github.com/SrdjanNikolin/GameCRUDApp) application. The API exposes endpoints needed for the game application to manage entities. Data is stored in a My SQL database which is accessed through Entity Framework Core. 

JWT authentication/authorization is also included.

*This project is not completely finished, it still needs some work/changes.*
